Pinger.py -- A ping tool that sits in your system tray

+ Currently for Ubuntu only
  - (Requires Python, GTK, and AppIndicator3)
  - Contributions welcome to implement cross-platform!
+ Saves your sanity when the wifi sucks
+ Doesn't clutter up your screen with ping windows
+ Lets you know when pings fail instead of silently failing
